What is an Array and how does it work?
  - List of elements of same type in contiguous sequence of memory
    - Can access the elements in constant time O(1) using this equation:
      `memory_address = starting_address + index * data_size`


What is a Hash Table and how does it work?
  - Underlying data structure is an.... Array!
    - Values are indexed by... hashing a key
    - Hash will return a large unsigned (large positive number) integer `%` (modulo, or mod) the size of the underlying array which you will use as an array index
    - Hashing collisions, or when 2 keys hash to the same index, are unavoidable (birthday problem)
    - Handle collisions using a Linked List (key/value pairs of the same index are chained together in the same bucket) or Open Addressing (key/value pairs of the same index are placed in the next available bucket)


What is a computer?
  - Many way to answer this. Two things to touch on are `PROCESSOR` and `MEMORY`.
    - Elaborate on one of the two... possiblities:
         * Turing Machines: a theoretical construct that consists of a mechanical processor + an infinite spool of read/write tape which can solve any theoretically computable problem: a trait known as being "Turing Complete"
          * The von Neumann architecture, which consists of a CPU (control + arithmetic/logic units), memory, input and output.
            * Billions of transistors on a chip carefully and logically arranged to interface with memory (RAM), an operating system + file system (hard drive), input (keyboard, mouse, camera, microphone, internet) and output (screen, audio, internet).
